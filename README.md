# country-colors.vim

A collection of themes for each country.

The preference here is dark themes. But there are some countries, like ğŸ‡¦ğŸ‡·, whose colour palette just doesn't make sense on a dark background. These countries are few. For these countries, the theme is suffixed with `-light`; all other country colours are suffixed with `-dark`.

## How to use

Install using your favourite plugin manager

```
Plug 'igbanam/country-colors.vim'

Use the 3-letter short code to select the theme i.e. `bhs` for Bahamas, `dza` for Algeria, `abw` for Aruba, and so on. To select the Greece theme,

```
:colorscheme=abw-light
```

## Contributing

There are many ways you can contribute. These colours are for basic Vim. You may want to add highlights for fancier plug-ins which have their own syntax groups (e.g. vim-airline). You may also notice some discrepancies you want to fix with the themes.
